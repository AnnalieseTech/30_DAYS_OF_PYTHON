# Python datetime
# Python has got datetime module to handle date and time.

import datetime
print(dir(datetime))
['MAXYEAR', 'MINYEAR', '__builtins__', '__cached__', '__doc__', '__file__', '__loader__', '__name__', '__package__', '__spec__', 'date', 'datetime', 'datetime_CAPI', 'sys', 'time', 'timedelta', 'timezone', 'tzinfo']

# With dir or help built-in commands it is possible to know the available functions in a certain module. As you can see, in the datetime module there are many functions, but we will focus on date, datetime, time and timedelta. Let se see them one by one.

# Getting datetime Information
from datetime import datetime
now = datetime.now()
print(now)                      # 2021-07-08 07:34:46.549883
day = now.day                   # 8
month = now.month               # 7
year = now.year                 # 2021
hour = now.hour                 # 7
minute = now.minute             # 38
second = now.second
timestamp = now.timestamp()
print(day, month, year, hour, minute)
print('timestamp', timestamp)
print(f'{day}/{month}/{year}, {hour}:{minute}')  # 8/7/2021, 7:38

# Timestamp or Unix timestamp is the number of seconds elapsed from 1st of January 1970 UTC.

# Formatting Date Output Using strftime
from datetime import datetime
new_year = datetime(2020, 1, 1)
print(new_year)      # 2020-01-01 00:00:00
day = new_year.day
month = new_year.month
year = new_year.year
hour = new_year.hour
minute = new_year.minute
second = new_year.second
print(day, month, year, hour, minute) #1 1 2020 0 0
print(f'{day}/{month}/{year}, {hour}:{minute}')  # 1/1/2020, 0:0

# Formatting date time using strftime method and the documentation can be found here.

from datetime import datetime
# current date and time
now = datetime.now()
t = now.strftime("%H:%M:%S")
print("time:", t)
time_one = now.strftime("%m/%d/%Y, %H:%M:%S")
# mm/dd/YY H:M:S format
print("time one:", time_one)
time_two = now.strftime("%d/%m/%Y, %H:%M:%S")
# dd/mm/YY H:M:S format
print("time two:", time_two)
# time: 01:05:01
# time one: 12/05/2019, 01:05:01
# time two: 05/12/2019, 01:05:01

# Here are all the strftime symbols we use to format time. An example of all the formats for this module.

# String to Time Using strptime
# Here is a documentation hat helps to understand the format.

# Think, what can you use the datetime module for? Examples:
# Time series analysis
# For analyzing data over a period of time, you can use datetime to parse dates and times, calculate time differences, and more.
git
# To get a timestamp of any activities in an application
# Track when specific events happen in your application, such as logging user activities.

# Adding posts on a blog
# Record the date and time when a blog post is created, updated, or published.
